# OpenStarLab
OpenStarLab is an open source laboratory environment for off planet research computing workloads. OpenStarLab operates on simple, inexpensive hardware, and runs open source tools to create a local intranet and private cloud environment for research computing workloads. OpenStarLab also localizes select global internet data, resources, knowledge, and content for use in disconnected environments. Open StarLab is a private cloud running on an edge computing device, meaning that it can operate autonomously with it's own intranet, and can sync with cloud resources when connected to the internet.

OpenStarLab was designed to function in off-planet environments in orbit, or in-situ. It is secure and highly reliable, with extensive disaster recovery mechanisms in place. It operates on low power when needed, and is optimized for low energy environments. While OpenStarLab is designed to operate among the stars, it is also a great candidate for wilderness, deep sea, and other remote applications. If you need to run your own little internet and cloud, but you can't connect to the internet or a cloud, or you need to do it privately or with limited energy resources -- OpenStarLab is the tool for you.

We are building this tool in the open to encourage active participation and collaboration. Please read the contributing guide to get started as a contributor.

## Features

### OpenStarBox

OpenStarBox is the dedicated hardware design system for Open StarLab. It is built from open source or open-ish source enclosures that can be fabricated easily in a makerspace and computing hardware components that are inexpensive, readily available to commercial users, and interchangeable. The reference deployment of OpenStarBox consists of 3D printed and machine aluminum enclosures, 4 RockPi Linux Single Board Computers (SBCs), commercially available harddrives and networking equipment, and off the shelf peripherals. We have attempted to make hardware interchangeable whenever possible and have optimized for energy efficiency, durability, cost, and component availability.

### OpenStarBoxMini

OpenStarBox mini is the edge outpost companion to OpenStarBox. It is designed to operate as a remote sensing device for environmental sensing and research. It runs a tiny web server with a simple API, 3 databases, and a basic remote sensing and actuating setup with temp, humidity, barometric pressure, acceleration, light, infrared, voc, gas, and magnetometer sensors. It runs on a lithium ion battery that can be charged through usb c, an optional solar module, or wireless inductive charging.

Disaster recovery server

#### Clean room lab

The Clean Room Lab allows researchers to share data collaboratively in a secure environment without sharing all of that data.

#### SpaceGit

SpaceGit is a locally hosted git repository that allows developers to centralize version control management from anywhere, even without an internet connection. SpaceGit syncs to user defined cloud git repos when connected to the internet.
